<body><div class="c7"><p class="c2"><span class="c8 c9">The Potluck Story</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c8">The Genesis</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c5">
    <span class="c4">It all began on a rather warm June weekend afternoon. Lockdown had deemed eating out or ordering food from the local biryani joint out of bounds. That&rsquo;s when this rather harried soul took it upon him to try his hand at some Chicken Dum Biryani and surprise his family. Contrary to what otherwise is a common phenomenon in most homes as the saying goes in Hindi &ndash; &ldquo;Ghar Ki Murgi Dal Barabar&rdquo;, it turned out pretty well and it passed one of the most difficult testing and approval standards &ndash; the children&rsquo;s approval test. We had a few extra portions and thought of sharing with other folks in the community. And thus the advertisement was put out &ndash; &ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c6">We have made some Hyderabadi Dum Biryani and we have 4 extra plates to share. Anyone willing to take a risk can pick it up for Rs 150/- a plate</span><span class="c4">&rdquo;. Added to it was a postscript &ndash; &ldquo;</span><span class="c4 c6">If you do not enjoy the meal, don&rsquo;t pay for it</span><span class="c3">&rdquo;. The biryanis got lapped up in a jiffy and guess what, everyone paid for it, happily. </span></p>
    <p class="c5"><span class="c0">The First Baby Steps</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">This led to a WhatsApp group being formed of like minded residents who were keen and excited about the concept of getting to tickle their taste buds with some delicacies from different cultures, cuisines, geography&hellip;and the interactions grew exponentially. Over the past few months we have been treated to some exquisite meals like Red Thai Curry, Vietnamese Pho, Sattu ka Paratha, Dabelis, Theplas, Dal Bati, range of Biryanis, Snacks, Cakes, Cookies, pastries, Donuts, lasagna, Pasta, Pizza, Durban Bunny Chow&hellip; the list could go on. And all these preparations could easily give the famous eateries in town a run for their money. </span></p><p class="c5">
        <span class="c3">As things began to get a bit challenging to manage on WhatsApp (people missing posts, people having to go through reams of messages to cull out what got their interest, difficulty in keeping track of orders received, remembering the multiple orders one had placed..) we embarked on a journey to put together an App that would serve the needs of this community. The concept and problem statement was shared with a few engineering colleges and students were invited to participate in a coding contest. After the preliminary screening two teams embarked on the journey to crack the code. This eventually led to one team presenting the proof of concept and taking on the task of designing the App for the first phase. What you now see and experience through this App is the fruit of the efforts of some very dedicated fine young men who were willing to get out of their comfort zones to learn, discover, grow and reach out to do something that is very unique and challenging. They were mentored and guided by some very senior industry professionals from the product design and technology domains. It has been a joy working with Abinash, Arul, Ajay, Divakar and Gowthamkrishnan from Kongu Engineering College. And they had the unstinted support of their HOD, Dr. N. Shanthi from the Computer Science Department. </span></p>
        <p class="c5"><span class="c0">The Higher Purpose and The Way Forward</span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c3">Growing up in Ranchi, the city that gave Dhoni to Indian Cricket, has etched some very fond memories in my mind. One of them is about the township and community we were a part of, where almost everyone knew everyone. The special dish that was cooked in my neighbour&rsquo;s house would often find its way to our dinner table. Spending time with friends would often end up with having a meal at his place. There was a true sense of community, which we seem to have missed out in these times. We live in communities, but barely know more than 5 people in the neighbourhood. </span>

        </p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c5" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c3">At Potluck, our hope is to rekindle that joy of living in a community - Living, sharing and thriving together. Food is just a medium to connect people. I never ever realized that baking a simple birthday cake for a neighbour could bring in so much joy at a time such as this. So go ahead and share some great food with your friends and neighbours. You must be having a few signature dishes that are relished by your family. And then, share some joy and some good cheer. </span></p><p class="c5">
