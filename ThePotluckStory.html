<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT SIZE=2>It all began on a
rather warm June weekend afternoon. Lockdown had deemed eating out or
ordering food from the local biryani joint out of bounds. That’s
when this rather harried soul took it upon him to try his hand at
some Chicken Dum Biryani and surprise his family. Contrary to what
otherwise is a common phenomenon in most homes as the saying goes in
Hindi – “Ghar Ki Murgi Dal Barabar”, it turned out pretty well
and it passed one of the most difficult testing and approval
standards – the children’s approval test. We had a few extra
portions and thought of sharing with other folks in the community.
And thus the advertisement was put out – We have made some
Hyderabadi Dum Biryani and we have 4 extra plates to share. Anyone
willing to take a risk can pick it up for Rs 150/- a plate. Added to
it was a postscript – If you do not enjoy the meal, don’t pay for
it. The biryanis got lapped up in a jiffy and guess what, everyone
paid for it – happily. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><B>The First Baby Steps</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT SIZE=2>This led to a WhatsApp
group being formed of likeminded residents who were keen and excited
about the concept of getting to tickle their taste buds with some
delicacies from a different culture, cuisine, geography…and the
interactions grew exponentially. Over the past few months we have
been treated to some exquisite meals like Red Thai Curry, Vietnamese
Pho, Sattu ka Paratha, Dabelis, Theplas, Dal Bati, range of Biryanis,
Snacks, Cakes, Cookies, pastries, Donuts, lassagna, Pasta, Pizza,
Durban Bunny Chow… the list could go on. And all these preparations
could easily give the famous eateries in town a run for their money. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT SIZE=2>As things began to get
difficult to manage on WhatsApp (people missing posts, people having
to go through reams of messages to cull out what got their
interest..) we embarked on a journey to put together an App that
would serve the needs of this community. The concept and problem
statement was shared with a few engineering colleges and students
were invited to participate in a coding contest. After the
preliminary screening two teams embarked on the journey to crack the
code. This eventually led to one team presenting the proof of concept
and taking on the task of designing the App for the first phase. What
you now see and experience through this App is the fruit of the
efforts of some very dedicated fine young men who were willing to get
out of their comfort zones to learn, discover, grow and reach out to
do something that very unique and challenging. They were mentored and
guided by some very senior industry professionals, both from the
product design and technology domains. It has been a joy working with
Abinash, Ajay, Arul, Divakar and Gowthamkrishnan from Kongu
Engineering College. And they had the unstinted support of their HOD,
Dr, Shanthi from the Computer Science Department. </FONT>

Forward</B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT SIZE=2>Growing up in Ranchi,
the city that gave Dhoni to Indian Cricket has etched some very fond
memories in my mind. One of them is about the township and community
we were a part of where almost everyone knew everyone. The special
dish that was cooked in my neighbour’s house would often find its
way to our dinner table. Spending time with friends would often end
up with having a meal at his place. There was a true sense of
community, which we seem to have missed out in these times. We live
in communities, but barely know more than 5 people in the
neighbourhood. </FONT>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in"><FONT SIZE=2>At Potluck, our
endeavour is to rekindle that joy of living in a community - Living,
sharing and thriving together. Food is just a medium to connect
people. I never ever realized that baking a simple birthday cake for
a neighbour could bring in so much joy in a time such as this. So go
ahead and share some great food with your friends and neighbours. You
must be having a few signature dishes that are relished by your
family. And then, share some joy and some good cheer. Welcome to the
Potluck Community.</FONT></P>
